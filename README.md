# Chris Koskey

I find myself needing to explain what has come before so you know where I am.

## Developer

I create applications that also happen to be destinations for your browser. From heavy state management user interfaces to SDK packages to micro services.
I think in data transformation pipelines and system life cycles.
I worry about supply chain attacks, how much energy the test suite consumes and if the people around me are happy.

I sense a [disturbance](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) in the force.

A partial [portfolio](/past-developments.md) if you are interested.

## Musician

I started playing out in bands long before I had adequate technical chops but I found that one's attitude could be more effective than ability so I continued on.
I have one [real](https://www.avclub.com/stereolab-pulse-of-the-early-brain-review-1849487080#:~:text=inch%20single%20with-,Soi%2DDisant%20in%201998,-.%20Occasionally%2C%23the%20compositions) [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXFyGpZzUpA) [7"](https://www.discogs.com/master/206410-Stereolab-Soi-Disant-Symbolic-Logic-Of-Now-Glitterati-Cruiser) and many things [laying around](https://soundcloud.com/thebacksof) on the internet that sound best in headphones.

The pandemic yielded [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKG8GjcVH9s&t=48s&ab_channel=thebacksof) from me. It harvested chaos in more ways than one.

## Bike Enthusiast

I prefer to ride a bike or take public transit over driving a car.

## Sensor Minder

I starting paying close attention to micro weather patterns once I used a bike for commuting back when commuting was a thing programmers did. Portland Oregon tends to rain or at least it used to. We also have had our fare amount of forest fires which has lead to checking the [AQI](https://oraqi.deq.state.or.us/home/map) daily. Bad air + cardio = hurt lungs.

## Skater

I grew up skateboarding. Transportation, physical feats and social experiences otherwise unattainable. Skating transcended all social barriers.
Independent yet locked together in the joy of just trying to land that new trick. Everyone was welcome as long as you were additive.
If you were positive and wanted to progress then everyone had your back no matter who or what you were.

I've kept this social ideal in my back pocket the whole time.

## Progenitor

I have 2 children. Details are forthcoming...
